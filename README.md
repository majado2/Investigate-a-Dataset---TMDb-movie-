# (Investigate a Dataset - TMDb movie data )
## by (Abdulmjeed Adahasi)



## Introduction

> This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is. The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

## Conclusions
Based on our first question, I noticed that production has advanced in the years, and this indicates the growth of the film production sector. But the question remains, does this mean an increase in profits? We asked the second question: Are profits also growing? The answer was clearly through the data. There is an increasing growth To keep us the last question, do budgets have an impact on profits? Indeed, it is an influential factor, which was evident through the presentation of the budgets and annual profits of the films.

It seems to me through the current investigation that spending in budgets has developed, as well as profits, which means the growth of the market and we may witness booms in the coming years.

### Limitations
The database is limited. There is a lot of loss in the columns that we may infer in. Also, we cannot reach the budget and revenue for each film over the years. We also cannot access the channels through which the films are sold to find out the reason for the growth of revenues. This verification generally reflects the growth of the budget and profits, which It gives investors the impression in general that the market is growing and profits also cannot be relied on definitively on the figures from this investigation due to the limited data.
